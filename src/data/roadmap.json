    "External Description": "The Palladium Hotel Group hotel chain was founded in the late 1960s in Ibiza by businessman Abel Matutes Juan, who dreamed of bringing paradise within the reach of travellers and offering them amazing experiences. He set out to design the most exclusive accommodation, based on the fundamental concepts of luxury, quality and first-class service. He took his first steps in the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, and in the early 1990s he continued the adventure by opening several resorts in the Caribbean. He then built on his success by opening hotels in top world destinations: Spain, Italy, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Jamaica and Brazil. In 2000, these hotels were grouped together under the name of Fiesta Hotel Group. In 2012, the group opted to update its company image and became Palladium Hotel Group, taking its name from its five-star Caribbean resorts. The aim is to convey a corporate philosophy based on excellence and on high standards of quality, as well as the drive to progress and increase the group's international profile. Palladium Hotel Group was created to clearly define the direction of a new stage in which the customer and human capital are the Group's priority.",
