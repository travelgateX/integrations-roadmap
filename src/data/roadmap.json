Collectively, they represent around 85% of total tourism industry turnover. The more members and support TIA has, the stronger our influence and the more we can achieve\n\nWINGSPAN\nPan Pacific Travel is proud to support the Wingspan Programme and in particular their work with the threatened New Zealand Falcon.\nWe sponsor \"Maia\", a very special falcon who was one of the falcons bred at Wingspan and released as part of \"On the Wing\"; the first ever city release of a threatened species.\nWhile Maia was released in 2014, she remains (almost on a daily basis) returning to the Rotorua Museum (Government Gardens) for supplementary food left out for her, but generally resides (and nests) in the Redwoods in Whakarewarewa Forest.\n\nSUSTAINABLE TOURISM\nPan Pacific has signed up to the Tourism Sustainability Commitment and joined a fast-growing group of New Zealand tourism operators who are working to make a positive difference.\nThe New Zealand Tourism Sustainability commitment aims to see every New Zealand tourism business committed to sustainability by 2025 - with a Vision of Leading the World in Sustainable Tourism. To deliver on this, we must achieve ambitious economic goals while sharing the overwhelming benefits with supportive host communities, contributing to restoring, protecting and enhancing our natural environment, and continuing to be a high quality destination of choice for domestic and international travellers.",

    "External Description": "The Palladium Hotel Group hotel chain was founded in the late 1960s in Ibiza by businessman Abel Matutes Juan, who dreamed of bringing paradise within the reach of travellers and offering them amazing experiences. He set out to design the most exclusive accommodation, based on the fundamental concepts of luxury, quality and first-class service. He took his first steps in the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, and in the early 1990s he continued the adventure by opening several resorts in the Caribbean. He then built on his success by opening hotels in top world destinations: Spain, Italy, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Jamaica and Brazil. In 2000, these hotels were grouped together under the name of Fiesta Hotel Group. In 2012, the group opted to update its company image and became Palladium Hotel Group, taking its name from its five-star Caribbean resorts. The aim is to convey a corporate philosophy based on excellence and on high standards of quality, as well as the drive to progress and increase the group's international profile. Palladium Hotel Group was created to clearly define the direction of a new stage in which the customer and human capital are the Group's priority.",
